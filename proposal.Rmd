This data set that came from IMDb, includes data about the 1,000 most popular movies that came out from 2006 - 2016. Useful variables include Title, Director, Year, Runtime, Rating, Metascore, & Revenue. There are some dirtier variables like Description, Actors, & Genre that contain lengthy character strings that will need to be parsed and cleaned or simply omitted from the data we use.
